# basic-calculator
Calculator with basic operations, made with HTML, CSS and Javascript

This was my first calculator made with HTML, CSS and Javascript

My main objective was to manage what was typed on the screen,
so the math expression would be correct

What i learned on this project:
- How to replace specific characters on a string;
- How to convert a string in a math expression;
